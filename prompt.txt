Create a visually engaging, educational web game using Svelte.js that interactively teaches and demonstrates event-driven architecture concepts. The game's visual style should emulate the vibrant, minimalist aesthetic of Kurzgesagt animations, using flat design elements, bold color palettes, and smooth transitions.

Key requirements include:

Interactive visual representation of core event-driven concepts such as events, event emitters, event listeners, queues, and handlers.

Allow users to create, trigger, and manage events through drag-and-drop or clickable components, clearly visualizing event propagation and handling.

Include real-time animations that depict event flows and interactions, emphasizing asynchronous operations and event queues.

Provide interactive scenarios or puzzles where users can experiment with managing complex event-driven systems, learning through exploration and immediate feedback.

Include brief, clear explanations within the interface to educate users on each core concept as they interact with components.

Ensure responsiveness, accessibility, and intuitive navigation to support seamless learning experiences for diverse user groups.
